= Chapter 3

In "Free Moves" chapter, I added a method to `NFA` called `_current_states` as I don't have `Struct` in TS.

Also insetad of using `null` for free moves, I used an empty string.

In "Regular Expressions" instead of creating states as `new Object()`, 
I used funtions `new_state()` that returns incremented numbers. It helps in debugging.

In "Parser" I tried `ts-pegjs`
