= Chapter 2

As TS is not Ruby I'll need to do some workarounds.

I have a base class `Expression` instead of Ruby's `Struct`.

`Machite#run` returns a list of expressions instead of printing them.
That's easier to test.

I use https://peggyjs.org/[Peggy] as a parser.
To replace Treetop.

Before running parser tests, run

$ npm run parser
